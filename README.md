## Overview

**Smart Vision Technology for Quality Control** is an intelligent system designed to automate product inspection and quality assurance in retail, food, and manufacturing industries. Developed for the **Flipkart GRiD 6.0 - Robotics Challenge Hackathon 2024 (Level 2)**, the project integrates cutting-edge technologies such as:

- Optical Character Recognition (OCR)
- Infrared (IR) Sensor-based Counting
- Image Processing & Computer Vision
- Machine Learning & Deep Learning

By combining these technologies, the system improves **accuracy, efficiency, and consistency** in quality control processes such as:

- Product detail extraction (brand name, type)
- Pricing and expiry date detection
- Real-time product counting
- Freshness detection for perishable goods (e.g., apples)

---

## Features

### üîç OCR-Based Label Analysis
- Extracts **brand names** and **product types** from packaging.
- Automates inventory categorization and authenticity checks.

### üè∑Ô∏è Price & Expiry Date Detection
- Uses OCR to detect **MRP** and **expiry dates** from labels.
- Enhances consumer safety and pricing accuracy.

### üî¢ IR Sensor-Based Product Counting
- Tracks product flow on conveyors in real time.
- Improves inventory accuracy and reduces manual labor.

### üçè Produce Freshness Detection
- Image processing determines fruit freshness using **color** and **texture** analysis.
- Reduces food waste and ensures product quality.

---

## Tech Stack

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries & Frameworks**:
  - TensorFlow, Keras (Deep Learning)
  - OpenCV (Computer Vision)
  - Tesseract OCR (Text Extraction)
- **Hardware Integration**: Infrared Sensors (for counting mechanism)

---
